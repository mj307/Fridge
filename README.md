# Leftover Lens
Leftover Lens is a computer vision and AI application designed to help users reduce food waste by generating recipes based on older food items. By transforming near-expiry ingredients into delicious meals, we aim to promote sustainability and creative cooking.

## Inspiration
Our journey began with a shared concern about food waste. As first-time apartment dwellers responsible for cooking, we often found ourselves with unused ingredients that went bad. We realized that many people face similar challenges, leading to unnecessary waste. This inspired us to create Leftover Lensâ€”a tool that empowers individuals to make the most of their food, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable future.


## Features
* Food Scanning: Use computer vision to identify older food items in your kitchen
 
* Recipe Generation: Get recipe suggestions tailored to your available ingredients
 
* Waste Reduction: Minimize food waste while discovering new meal ideas

## Technologies Used
- OpenCV & YOLO: For object detection and food identification
  
- Llama: For generating intelligent recipe suggestions

Future Plans
Looking ahead, we plan to enhance Leftover Lens by adding community features, including:
- A donation option for users to share meals they create.
- A community space for users to exchange recipe ideas.
- A camera feature for easy scanning of ingredients directly.
